//diiffrence between let var const

var firstname = "subhash";
// there is no need to provide var . in javascript by default it is var
console.log(firstname);
firstname = "saurav";
console.log(firstname);
firstname = 2.5;
console.log(firstname);
firstname = 56;
console.log(firstname);

// we can change varaible anywhere and it will change its datatype

const sirname = "yadav";
console.log(sirname);
// sirname = "pundhir";
// console.log(sirname);

//but in const it will not change not even the value as well as data type
